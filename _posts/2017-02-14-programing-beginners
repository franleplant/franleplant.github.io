### Why people say I should use linux/unix? What is linux/unix?

A lot of non techincal people only know Windows.
It turns out that Windows is not a magical thing, it's just a program that
you interact with, and there are other programs like it. The type of program is called Operating System, OS

Linux defines, loosely, a family of Operating Systems which among the most known are:
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Fedora
- RedHat
- Android (phones)

Linux is a derivative of the Unix family which includes:

- FreeBSD
- MacOS (apple computer operating system)
- iOS

There are of course others, but we don't want to go all crazy about it, if you are interested
just search for `Operative Systems` in google an read more.

Why you should use Linux/Unix is a contribe question, but the pragmatic answer is:
- It will be easier to create and use programs.

For example, Ruby does not officially support Windows.
